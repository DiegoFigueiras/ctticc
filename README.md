# ctticc

Item characteristic curves (ICC's) are visual indicators of important attributes of assessment items - most typically *difficulty* and *discrimination*. Assessment specialists who examine ICC's usually do so from within the psychometric framework of either Item Response Theory (IRT) or Rasch modeling. This `R` package provides an extension of this tradition into the Classical Test Theory (CTT) framework. The package has `psych` and `ggplot2` dependencies that facilitate the estimation of CTT-generated difficulty (_pseudob_) and discrimination (_pseudoa_) "parameters". 

A nice summary of how to interpret IRT parameters is located here: https://wnarifin.github.io/simpler/irt_2PL.html

## Getting Started

> ~~Until the first release of posterdown occurs on CRAN please fork this repo and use your version to ensure stability while building your poster. Changes made here can be sporadic but also tend to be drastic. Otherwise, use this repo at your own discression! :trollface:~~

> posterdown v1.0 is now on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/posterdown/index.html) !! :smile:

To install from CRAN use `install.packages("posterdown")`.

To install from github use `remotes::install_github("brentthorne/posterdown")`. 

Now add this to the YAML options of your rmarkdown (.Rmd) file:

```markdown
---
output: 
  posterdown::posterdown_html
---
```

For further customization options please see the (currently in progress :hammer:) [wiki](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki)
